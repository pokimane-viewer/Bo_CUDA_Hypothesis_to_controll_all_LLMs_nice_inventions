Up‑grading kernels (e.g., flash‑attention v2) can speed training/inference **without retraining**, because the numerical contract of the op (e.g., `Y = softmax(Q Kᵀ/√d) V`) is preserved.


# Nice inventions

Summary – Training iteratively adjusts weight matrices so that multi‑head, multi‑layer transformations minimise next‑token loss over BPE‑encoded sequences. CUDA kernels are the computational plumbing that move float32/16/8 numbers around; they store no knowledge. At inference, the server’s max_new_tokens gate and the model’s fixed context length delimit how much of that learned mapping you can exploit in any single request.

Below is a concise, engineer‑level sketch of how a modern, CUDA‑accelerated transformer language model (LM) is trained and how its architectural choices (tokeniser, heads, layers, context window, server‑side generation limits) interplay during inference.

### 1. Input pipeline & tokenisation

1. **Byte‑pair encoding (BPE)** splits raw bytes into sub‑word units drawn from a learned vocabulary.
2. Training creates *paired sequences* = `prompt‖target`, padded/truncated to a fixed **context length T** (e.g., 4 096 tokens).
3. The LM is normally trained *causally*: at position *t* it must predict token *t + 1*. (Masked‑LM objectives mask, but the weight‑update machinery is identical.)

### 2. Training loop (high‑level)

```
for step in range(num_steps):
    x  = next_batch()         # [B, T] token ids
    Wt = embedding[x]         # token->vector lookup
    h  = transformer(Wt)      # B×T×D, D = hidden width
    logits = h @ W_outᵀ      # unnormalised scores
    loss = cross_entropy(logits, shifted_targets)
    loss.backward()           # compute ∇W for all params
    optimizer.step()          # Adam/Lion update
```

*All* floating‑point tensor ops above resolve to **GEMM/softmax/element‑wise kernels** launched by the deep‑learning framework. Custom fused CUDA kernels (e.g., flash‑attention) cut memory traffic and improve arithmetic intensity but don’t alter gradients or weight shapes.

### 3. What layers & heads buy you

| Component               | Parameter tensors (shape)                  | Role in weight‑space                                                                                   | Why multiple?                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Self‑attention head** | `{Q,K,V} ∈ ℝ^{D_h×D_k}`, `O ∈ ℝ^{D_k×D_h}` | Learns a *projection subspace* in which “alignment via dot‑product” surfaces task‑useful patterns.     | Each head explores a different subspace; concatenation then mixed by `W_O`.                                                 |
| **Layer (block)**       | Above + 2×MLP (feed‑forward) + layer‑norm  | Adds *depth*, letting gradients sculpt **hierarchies** of representations (syntax → semantics → task). | More layers ≈ greater function‑composition capacity; also increases effective receptive‑field length for a given head size. |

During back‑prop, each parameter matrix accumulates gradients from **all heads/positions/batches**; the optimiser permanently mutates the saved weights. Nothing inside a CUDA kernel is persistent—kernels merely read/write the weight buffers passed to them.

---

### 4. Saved weights versus CUDA kernels

* **Weights** live in GPU VRAM → loaded once per forward/backward pass.
* **Kernels** are compiled PTX/CUBIN blobs that implement `matmul`, `layernorm`, `softmax`, etc. They *never* encode learned numbers; they manipulate whichever weight tensors the runtime points them at.
* Up‑grading kernels (e.g., flash‑attention v2) can speed training/inference **without retraining**, because the numerical contract of the op (e.g., `Y = softmax(Q Kᵀ/√d) V`) is preserved.

---

### 5. Generation length, context, and accuracy

1. **Server‑side max‑tokens** (`max_new_tokens`) simply aborts sampling after *N* steps; it does **not** alter the network’s parameters.
2. **Longer continuations** ⇒ more autoregressive steps ⇒ more chance to drift, but also more room for the model to “recover” by conditioning on its own outputs.
3. **Context window T** (a compile‑time hyper‑parameter) caps what the attention kernels can see. If the server lets you request ≤ T tokens of *prompt + generation*, every new token still attends to the full preceding window in a single pass.
4. Larger **parameter count** (depth × width × heads) improves the *expressivity* of the function that maps context → next‑token distribution, but it does not by itself enlarge *T* or uncap `max_new_tokens`.

---

### 6. Putting it together for code synthesis

* Feeding the model rich **domain context** (API docs, partial kernels, error traces) positions relevant tokens into attention range; specialised heads that co‑adapted during training can then fire on those structural cues.
* A generous server‑side generation limit lets the decoder explore longer hypothesis chains (e.g., full CUDA kernels rather than snippets), still bounded by *T*.
* Because kernels are comprised mostly of regular control flow and GEMMs—patterns ubiquitous in the training corpus—the model’s weight space is likely dense in vectors that encode such structures, leading to reliable synthesis when the prompt “grounds” the right sub‑manifold.

---

**Summary** – Training iteratively adjusts weight matrices so that multi‑head, multi‑layer transformations minimise next‑token loss over BPE‑encoded sequences. CUDA kernels are the *computational plumbing* that move float32/16/8 numbers around; they store no knowledge. At inference, the server’s `max_new_tokens` gate and the model’s fixed context length delimit how much of that learned mapping you can exploit in any single request.
